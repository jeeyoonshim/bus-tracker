## Real Time Bus Tracker
Exercise in animating map markers to move along bus stops. This exercise allowed me to use the Mapbox API, and was a challenge in learning how to pull data from APIs, as well as using Mapbox's library of available features.

Click on "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button on the top left corner to see the map marker move along the stops between MIT and Harvard.
